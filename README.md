# Firebase Transaction with Async Operations: Data Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Firebase Realtime Database transactions with asynchronous operations. The problem arises when the transaction callback accesses variables modified asynchronously before the transaction completes, resulting in inconsistent data.

## Problem Description
The code attempts to increment a value in the Firebase database using a transaction. However, an asynchronous operation (simulated here with `setTimeout`) modifies the variable used in the transaction before the transaction completes. This causes the transaction to use a stale value, leading to incorrect results.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the value used in the transaction callback is not modified asynchronously before the transaction is finished.  A promise-based approach or using a local copy of the value are effective methods to avoid this.
